Goals for this project:
	- Organically grow code with features
	- Try to avoid complexity through separation of responsibility and with TDD.
	- Remain as clean as possible.

Tasks
	- Plantago rendering performance (Don't need to re-render for every frame!)
	  - Lots of images/stuff to render each frame. How to optimize (MDN article. maybe layered canvases?)
	- Plantago bush doesn't render branches at proper z-index (Canvas bug/unknown behavior?)
	- Make the tests more performant when not running UI test
	- Bugs have more interesting behavior
	- Plantago dynamic size
	- Plantago can be mirrored

Aspects
	- Portability
		- The app doesn't depend on anything but a canvas
		- Bug logic is separated from visual logic
		- The app builds into a single/several .js files that can be called in vanillajs.
		- Performant with many entities.

	- Testing
		- Full TDD
		
	- visual
		- Realistic animated images.
