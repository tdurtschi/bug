Goals for this project:
	- Organically grow code with features
	- Try to avoid complexity through separation of responsibility and with TDD.
	- Remain as clean as possible.

Tasks
	- Create Readme.md
	- I want to see a bug on a canvas
	- I want to see a bug move across the canvas without hitting the wall
	- The bug climbs on a 90 degree line

Aspects
	- Portability
		- The app doesn't depend on anything but a canvas
		- Bug logic is separated from visual logic
		- The app builds into a single/several .js files that can be called in vanillajs.
		- Performant with many entities.

	- Testing
		- Full TDD
		
	- visual
		- Realistic animated images.
